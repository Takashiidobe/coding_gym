# Coding-Gym

This is a repository that contains some of the programming questions sent by the
email subscription 'daily coding problem'.

These do not have any answers, so its a community effort to answer them!

## Get Started

To begin participating, git clone this repo, with:
`git clone https://github.com/Takashiidobe/coding_gym.git` navigate your way to
the daily_coding_problems folder, find a question you'd like to solve and get
answering!

The only thing I ask is that if you are the first one to submit an answer to a
question, put it in a folder labelled answer, along with your code, and I will
merge it to the main repo.

Make sure to mark your answer with your github username or real name (whichever
you prefer) for posterity when you push your answers!

## To-do

#### Other Problem Sets

If you'd like to suggest problem sets to work on, go right ahead. It would also
be great if you could document them in the format that I have for the
daily_coding_problem and make a PR!

#### Original Problems

If you have an original problem, feel free to document it in the
original_problems folder and upload the problem into the folder.
